### Introduction

Assuming that each time the bet is placed by Sam it is accepted by all 35 students, i.e. if Sam wins the bet he receives 1 dollar from all 35 students but if he loses he must pay all students 2 dollars for a total winning of 35$ or a total loss of 70$.

### Methods

The code in this project was created largely through ChatGPT, particularly the construction of the base array that was used throughout the rest of the project.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
numbers <- 1:365

repeated_numbers <- rep(numbers, each = 4)

final_array <- c(repeated_numbers, 366)

bdaybag <- array(final_array, dim = c(4, 365))

probability_success_single_trial <- (4/1460) * (3/1460) + (1 - (4/1460)) * (1 - (3/1460))

cat("The probability of success in a single trial is:", probability_success_single_trial, "\n")
sample_proportion <- 0.728

total_trials <- 637

critical_value <- qnorm(0.975)  # 1.96 for a 95% confidence interval

standard_error <- sqrt((sample_proportion * (1 - sample_proportion)) / total_trials)

margin_of_error <- critical_value * standard_error

lower_bound <- sample_proportion - margin_of_error
upper_bound <- sample_proportion + margin_of_error

cat("95% Confidence Interval: (", lower_bound, ", ", upper_bound, ")\n")

probability_success <- 0.728

probability_failure <- 1 - probability_success

gain_per_success <- 35

loss_per_failure <- 70

expected_value <- (probability_success * gain_per_success) - (probability_failure * loss_per_failure)

total_expected_money <- expected_value * 637

cat("The expected money Sam has after 637 bets based on the 95% confidence interval for the odds is +$", total_expected_money, "\n")
```

These values
